# RISC-V Spike Simulator SDK

In the recent version of the riscv-tools and freedom-u-sdk, both of them removed the support of the spike simulator, and tutorials about running Linux on spike is using static compiled busybox, which is not suitable for real test environments. Spike is the simplest simulator of RISC-V, it has a very clear description of the instructions, you can apply your ideas and check it for a quick try. The **R**ISC-V **S**pike **S**imulator SDK wants to help people to test design with 64-bit Linux environment on Spike easily, the basic framework is based on Freedom U SDK version 1.0.

This SDK will provide great convenience for the following people who:

* want to run upstream version Linux on Spike
* want to test design in Linux environment with modified spike, gcc and other extension in toolchain
* want to have a overview about embedded system development

This SDK follows the newest Linux Kernel, GNU toolchain and Spike, the functions of each folder in the project are as follows:

|       Folder        |      Description       |   Version   |
| :-----------------: | :--------------------: | :---------: |
|    repo/buildroot    |    Build initramfs     |  2025.08.x  |
|      repo/linux      |      Linux Kernel      |    v6.17.2    |
| repo/riscv-gnu-toolchain | GNU Compiler Toolchain |  gcc 15.1.0 ld 2.45  |
| repo/riscv-(isa-sim,pk)  | Simulator & Bootloader |    master   |
| repo/opensbi  | Supervisor / Bootloader |    v1.7   |
|         conf        |     config for SDK     |             |

## Quickstart
Build dependencies on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler autoconf automake autotools-dev    \
curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo \
gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev python-dev python3-dev unzip \
libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev git rsync wget cpio
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riscv-zju/riscv-rss-sdk.git

# For people who only want to have a try
sh quickstart.sh
# For people who want to develop the whole system
git submodule update --init --recursive --progress

#	NOTICE: 
# 		If you already have a riscv toolchain, please notice ** DO NOT SET
#		 $RISCV and MAKE SURE NO ORIGIN RISCV TOOLCHAIN IN YOUR $PATH **
make
```

## Software Development

The default process will only build Linux cross-compiler, which has prefix "riscv64-unknown-linux", if you want using newlib, you can use `make newlib` to build, then you can use pk as a kernel to run your program.

The main compile process will run vmlinux on spike directly, to add your test program, you should add your elfs in `./work/buildroot_initramfs_sysroot` and `make` again.

**NOTICE**: The test program should use Linux cross-compiler to compile , instead of Newlib cross-compiler.

If the benchmark you choose need some package, you can use `make buildroot_initramfs-menuconfig` to reconfigure buildroot and `touch buildroot && make` to rebuild. 

Same to linux, if you want to add driver for new devices, `make linux-menuconfig` to reconfigure, `touch linux && make` to rebuild.

## If you want to build step by step ...

1. Build RISC-V GNU Toolchain

   The key to build the dynamic link elf is using the correspond kernel version header to build the gnu toolchain. And if you want to use this SDK to do some development on your own chip, you may also need to change ARCH@ABI. 

2.  Build rootfs

	Using `buildroot` to help you to build a rootfs, you can add config in `conf/buildroot_initramfs_config` to add package, and you can copy your pre-compiled elf to `rootfs/initramfs_sysroot` to access in Spike.
	And remember, the basic idea of this SDK is to deconfig all the device, because spike is very limited support for devices, specically the Ethernet, so you should not open DHCP.

3. Compile Linux

   You can find config in `work/linux_defconfig`.

4. Bootloader

   You can choose between `bbl` or `opensbi` to use as bootloader to launch the simulation. Either edit the default in the Makefile or launch
   ```bash
   # default
   BL=opensbi make
   # or
   BL=bbl make
   ```

5. Spike

   The default account is root, [here](conf/boot.log) is a terminal log from Linux 5.8.0.

6. Debug via JTAG (for starship)

	You can use the openocd to debug our FPGA by the following openocd configuration file `conf/starship.cfg`
	```
		adapter speed 1000
		adapter driver ftdi
		ftdi vid_pid 0x0403 0x6010
		ftdi channel 0
		ftdi layout_init 0x00e8 0x60eb
		reset_config none
		transport select jtag
		set _CHIPNAME riscv
		jtag newtap $_CHIPNAME cpu -irlen 5

		set _TARGETNAME $_CHIPNAME.cpu

		target create $_TARGETNAME.0 riscv -chain-position $_TARGETNAME
		$_TARGETNAME.0 configure -work-area-phys 0x80000000 -work-area-size 10000 -work-area-backup 1
		riscv use_bscan_tunnel 0
	```
	
	This configuration has been proved validly on VC707 and FTDI2332. 
	The vid_pid is the vendor id and product id of the FTDI device, and you can get this paramter by run `lsusb`
	The ftdi channel is the channel id of the jtag channel while the ftdi USB device has 4 channel
	If your connection between jtag port and debug board is correct, when you run `openocd -f conf/starship.cfg`, the following output means your openocd connects the fpga debug module successfully.

		[riscv.cpu.0] Target successfully examined.
		Info : starting gdb server for riscv.cpu.0 on 3333
		Info : Listening on port 3333 for gdb connections
	```
	Then you can use gdb to debug fpga by remote connecting the 3333 port.

Finally, if you have any suggestions for this SDK, please *push* it !
